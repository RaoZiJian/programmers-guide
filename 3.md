# Chapter 3: Sprites

## What are Sprites
A Sprite is a 2D image that can be animated or transformed by changing its properties
like `rotation`, `position`, `scale`, `color`, etc.

`Sprite` is the base FIXME

## Creating Sprites

FIXME: Add why user needs different types of `create` ?
What happens if I create it from PNG ? what's the size ?

### Creating a Sprite
```cpp
auto mySprite = Sprite::create("mysprite.png");
```

### Creating a Sprite From a SpriteFrame
```cpp
auto frame = SpriteFrame::createWithTexture(texture, rect, offset);

auto mysprite = Sprite::createWithSpriteFrame(frame);
```
### Creating a Sprite From SpriteCache
```cpp
auto mysprite = Sprite::createWithSpriteFrameName("mysprite.png");
```
### Creating a Sprite From a Rect
```cpp
auto mySprite = Sprite::create("mysprite.png", Rect(0,0,40,40));
```
## Sprite Manipulation
After creating a Sprite, there are a variety of functions that can be applied to it.

FIXME: Describe all sprite properties.

Given:
```cpp
auto mySprite = Sprite::create("mysprite.png");
```
### Resizing (FIXME: scale does not resize the sprite). Add images. What happens. Add source code.
```cpp
// increases X and Y size by 4.0 uniformly
mySprite->setScale(4.0);

// increases just X scale by 4.0
mySprite->setScaleX(4.0);

// increases just Y scale by 4.0
mySprite->setScaleY(4.0);
```
### Anchor Point and Position
![](2/2n_level1_anchorpoint_0_0.png "") ![](2/smallSpacer.png "") ![](2/2n_level1_anchorpoint_05_05.png "") ![](2/smallSpacer.png "") ![](2/2n_level1_anchorpoint_1_1.png "")

```cpp
// bottom left
mySprite->setAnchorPoint(0, 0);

// middle
mySprite->setAnchorPoint(0.5, 0.5);

// top right
mySprite->setAnchorPoint(1, 1);
```

### Skew
```cpp
// adjusts the X and Y skew by 4.0 uniformly
mySprite->setSkew(4.0);

// adjusts the X skew by 4.0
mySprite->setSkewX(4.0);

// adjusts the Y skew by 4.0
mySprite->setSkewY(4.0);
```
## Sprite Sheets
A sprite sheet a way to combine sprites into a single texture while reducing the
overall size compared to loading each Sprite individually. Why does this matter?
When loading a `Sprite` each hardware platform has constraints of a minimum texture
size that it will need to load. As you can imagine there is a lot of unused space
and this increases memory consumption, draw times and lowers your games frame rate.
Using a `sprite sheet` allows all of your sprites to be condensed filing unused space.
Now only the entire spritesheet must meet the hardwares constraints and can be
loaded all at the same time. This means you will significantly reduce memory usage,
reduce the time it takes OpenGL to draw your sprites and keep the frame rate of
your game high.

Here is an example sprite sheet:

![](3/3_1.png "example SpriteSheet")

Load your sprite sheet into the `SpriteFrameCache`, probably in AppDelegate:
```cpp
auto spritecache = SpriteFrameCache::getInstance();
spritecache->addSpriteFramesWithFile("sprites.plist");
```
A few examples of working with a sprite sheet:

Creating a `Sprite` from the `SpriteFrameCache`
```cpp
auto mySprite = Sprite::createWithSpriteFrameName("mysprite.png");
```
Creating an `Animation` from `SpriteFrameCache`
```cpp
auto anim1 = Animation::create();
anim1->addSpriteFrameWithFile("enemystand.png");
anim1->addSpriteFrameWithFile("enemymove1.png");
anim1->addSpriteFrameWithFile("enemymove2.png");
anim1->addSpriteFrameWithFile("enemymove3.png");
anim1->addSpriteFrameWithFile("enemymove4.png");
anim1->addSpriteFrameWithFile("enemymove5.png");
anim1->addSpriteFrameWithFile("enemyjump.png");

auto animation = Animate::create(anim1);
animation->setDuration(0.2f);
sprite->runAction(RepeatForever::create(animation));
```
